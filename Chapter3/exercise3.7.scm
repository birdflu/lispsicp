; Consider the bank account objects created by
; make-account, with the password modification described
; in Exercise 3.3. Suppose that our banking system requires
; the ability to make joint accounts. Define a procedure make-
; joint that accomplishes this. make-joint should take three
; arguments. e first is a password-protected account. e
; second argument must match the password with which the
; account was defined in order for the make-joint operation
; to proceed. e third argument is a new password. make-
; joint is to create an additional access to the original ac-
; count using the new password. For example, if peter-acc
; is a bank account with password open-sesame, then
; (define paul-acc
; (make-joint peter-acc 'open-sesame 'rosebud))
; will allow one to make transactions on peter-acc using the
; name paul-acc and the password rosebud. You may wish
; to modify your solution to Exercise 3.3 to accommodate this
; new feature.
