; Write a procedure make-monitored that takes as input a procedure, f,
; that itself takes one input. The result returned by make-monitored 
; is a third procedure, say mf, that keeps track of the number of 
; times it has been called by maintaining an internal counter. 
; If the input to mf is the special symbol how-many-calls?, 
; then mf returns the value of the counter.
; If the input is the special symbol reset-count, then mf resets
; the counter to zero. For any other input, mf returns the result 
; of calling f on that input and increments the counter.


(define (make-monitored fn)
  (let ((counter 0))
    (define f (Î» (x) (begin (set! counter (+ counter 1)) (fn x))))
    (define (mf m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'how-many-calls?) counter)
            ((eq? m 'reset-count) (begin (set! counter 0) counter))
            (else (f m))
            ))
    mf))
