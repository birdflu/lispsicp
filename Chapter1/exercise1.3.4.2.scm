; Since Newtonâ€™s method was itself expressed
; as a fixed-point process, we actually saw two ways to compute square
; roots as fixed points. Each method begins with a function and finds a
; fixed point of some transformation of the function. We can express this
; general idea itself as a procedure
; Procedure takes as its arguments a procedure g that computes some function,
; a procedure that transforms g, and an initial guess.
; The returned result is a fixed point of the transformed function.
