; The procedure iterative-improve takes two procedures
; as arguments: a method for telling whether a guess is good
; enough and a method for improving a guess. iterativeimprove
; should return as its value a procedure that takes a
; guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it is
; good enough. Then we rewrite the sqrt procedure 
; and the fixed-point procedure in terms of iterative-improve.
