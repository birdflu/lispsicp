; The half-interval method is a simple but powerful technique for finding
; roots of an equation f (x) = 0, where f is a continuous function. The
; idea is that, if we are given points a and b such that f (a) < 0 < f (b),
; then f must have at least one zero between a and b. To locate a zero,
; let x be the average of a and b, and compute f (x). If f (x) > 0, then
; f must have a zero between a and x. If f (x) < 0, then f must have a
; zero between x and b. Continuing in this way, we can identify smaller
; and smaller intervals on which f must have a zero. When we reach a
; point where the interval is small enough, the process stops.
; search is awkward to use directly, because we can accidentally give it
; points at which f â€™s values do not have the required sign, in which case
; we get a wrong answer. Instead we will use search via the following
; procedure, which checks to see which of the endpoints has a negative
; function value and which has a positive value, and calls the search procedure
; accordingly. If the function has the same sign on the two given
; points, the half-interval method cannot be used, in which case the procedure
; signals an error.
